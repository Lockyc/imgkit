# imgkit — notes for the next agent

A Go CLI of generic image and render operations for print and web pipelines.
The command set is in [README.md](README.md), the architecture in
[docs/design.md](docs/design.md), and **what is built and what comes next in
[docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md)**.

## When imgkit falls short, improve imgkit

This is the rule the repo exists for. If an operation does not give a result
good enough for the job, the fix goes into imgkit: a new engine, flag or
preset. Work it in this order:

1. Add a `quality/` case that reproduces the shortfall, with its metric.
2. Try the candidate approaches and measure each one on that case.
3. Land the winner. The commit body records every candidate and its number.

Thresholds in `quality/cases.toml` only ever get stricter. Declaring a result
impossible after one attempt, or hand-patching a consuming project's recipe
around imgkit, is the failure this rule exists to stop.

## Conventions

- **Generic only.** A crop box, path, colour or threshold tuned to one image
  belongs in the consuming project's recipe, passed as a flag.
- **One engine runner, one pin table.** Every external call goes through
  `internal/engine`, and every version lives in `internal/pins`. Never call
  `exec.Command` from an op package, and never restate a version in a doc or
  error string.
- **Python only for ML**, as embedded PEP 723 scripts with `exclude-newer`
  and a committed lockfile run `--locked`, model revisions pinned in
  `internal/pins`; upstream CLIs (LaMa) through `uv tool run`.
- **Portable.** No GNU-only or BSD-only flags in anything imgkit runs.
- **Mark synthesis.** A command that creates pixels the source never had
  honours the `imgkit.toml` policy (docs/design.md → Synthesis policy).
- **Public repo, self-contained tree.** No machine paths, no private
  hostnames, no consuming project's assets. `quality/` holds only openly
  licensed or synthetic images, each with its source and licence recorded.
- Working notes go in the gitignored `.superpowers/` and `docs/superpowers/`.
  Tracked docs never reference them.

## Branch and release

Main-only. Semver, with `VERSION` as the single source, embedded in the
binary. A release is a `vX.Y.Z` tag plus a GitHub release with notes, and
the README is curated at each release.

## Commands

```bash
just build | just test | just gate | just quality | just lock-ml | just install
```
